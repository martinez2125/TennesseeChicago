# Introduction

Word count: 250–450 words

This is the first written element of an edition: the first content readers encounter.

The purpose of this introduction is to set the scene: to provide an initial description of the source as well as an overview your edition, highlighting its features and supplements. This is not a space for much detail about the source or our editorial work with it. Later sections will allow you to do that. Here, your job is to help readers understand that they are looking at a digital edition of a historical source and why that source is interesting.

The premium is on precise, no-nonsense prose.

At bottom, you should include:

**How to Cite:**
Here, provide a citation using this model:

> Lastname, Firstname, FirstName LastName, and FirstName, Lastname. “Title of Web Page.” Name of Website (if different from web page). Publication or Revision Date. URL.

Your teams have multiple authors.  In scholarship, if authorship is equal across all team members, then the custom is to list by last name them in alphabetical order.  If you wish to deviate from this order you can but that will communicate priority (i.e. that the one who goes first is the 'lead author', etc.).

If you choose and wish to do so, you may also include a Creative Commons license here. We'll discuss those in class.

Here and throughout your edition, you should use footnotes in Chicago Notes and Bibliography style.[^1]  Please note that if sources are listed in your bibliography (and all your main ones should be), you may use a shortened form in these notes (e.g. Smith, _Towards a Better Understanding_, 5, with the full citation to Smith going in the bibliography).

# The Source

Sample:
Entering The Work Force


My working career started in May 1943, I had just turned 16 and immediately went to my high school counselor and got my working permit. I applied at a few different places, Alden's (a competitor of Sears) hired me and I was so excited - I was hired as a clerk and would be earning 12 ½ cents an hour (Wow!). Alden's was located on Grand Avenue, just a block west of Harlem Avenue, on the north side of the street - where Goldblatt's eventually took over. Would you believe, I was there only 2 days when Montgomery Ward's called and asked me to work there. I was so excited that I told Alden's I was quitting- after all, Montgomery Wards offered to double my wages - I would be earning 25 cents an hour. (Ward's was located on Grand Avenue, exactly across the street from Alden’s) Yippee!


Life at Montgomery Ward's was not so glamorous! The first week they had me dusting, cleaning, and watering their house plants. They had live houseplants in the middle of the store. The plants were in individual pots, but they must have been planted in "pop-up" soil, as there was more dirt and mud outside and around the plants than there was inside the pots. The dirt must have been a good inch deep around the base of all the pots. - Yuck! They did not give me any tools to work with; so I improvised with cardboard, etc. Naturally I fell back on Mother Nature's gifts to me, my fingernails. I would spend hours at night soaking and cleaning my hands, and repairing my broken and dirty nails. I was very unhappy; but the worst was yet to come!!!!!!!!!!

This section provides the main presentation of your source, as you have prepared it for readers (i.e., a facsimile, transcription, video, audio clip, etc.). This section is where we satisfy the first of the ADE’s three criteria for an electronic edition by providing a rigorous, accurate presentation of historical material.

For the presentation of some sources, it may make sense to break up the presentation into multiple pages. For that, as needed, we can use a more book like template (binding multiple pages together) that I can provide. Nonetheless, this page should be the page from which all presentations of the source itself start.

This may also be a space where editorial annotations are provided, such as notes on provenance, archival location, transcription, and more. If possible, a link to the source’s permanent digital location should be included here as well as a citation for that location. This should be done in consultation with the instructors, editorial board, and peer reviewers.

Please note: some presentations may benefit from a multipage format (rather than one scrolling page, as here). I can make a multipage template available to you as needed.

# About this Source

   The act of creating a homemade family archive is by no means a new process. Historically, many families have taken their own approaches to preserving and documenting their family history. Although no two family archives are exactly the same, certain patterns do exist across the history of their creation. Most family archives are based heavily on “home sources”, or documents that have originally been created and kept by the family. The most common home sources that are included in family archives are photographs and both written and typed statements. The statement becomes a particularly interesting part of the family archive to observe, as in an attempt to create a more extensive documentation of family lineage, many family archivists utilize the “family group record”, or another form of a similar content and structure. This specific record takes note of major genealogical information–parents and their children, births, and deaths. The presence of this form (although varied) across multiple family archives illustrates what seems to be considered the core of a family’s history. Other common trends in family archives include the presence of public records, such as death certificates, marriage certificates, gravestones, and newspapers. These specific records are some of the more readily accessible records to the public, and the important genealogical information they contain seem to be the main reason for their presence across family archives.  
   Aside from the value family archives hold as means of preserving a family’s history, they hold value in the historic information they contain through simply the act of recording a family’s story. With the use of family archives, historians are able to glean into the lives of ordinary people during major historic periods, and gain a richer understanding of historic life. Family archives can also illuminate human patterns in history, such as migration and demographics, with the human nature of family archives ensuring historians consider the human nature of history itself.
   This edition aims to provide deeper insight into the family archive of one specific family, the Hilton’s. The structure of this specific family archive seems to follow in the footsteps and trends of other American family archives created between the 19th and 20th centuries. Many of the pages within a family binder this archive includes are made up entirely of photographs, and much of the more detailed parts of this family’s history are recorded in typed statements created by the family archivist. When viewing this source through the lens of what historians can understand from it, a few key histories the Hilton family archive contains includes the urban development (demographic, neighborhood, industry) in the 20th century, life during the Great Depression, and the life of migrant families in the US.

   The members of the Hilton and subsequently Marsells families have in many ways refined the methods and practices which help to enable this bridging of inter-generational gaps. Through series of carefully assembled and thoughtfully arranged biographical documents, photographs, and recorded stories of everyday life, one feels like these individuals included within these pages can be accessed directly, as real people who lead real and complex lives, rather than them be relegated to almost a “data marker”; a name with a set of dates. We can largely thank the work of Alma Elizabeth Hilton Marsells and her brother, Richard Allen Hilton, for enabling this ability in the set of documents presented as a part of this edition, as for without the methods of storytelling and preservation, both physically and otherwise, that they have laid out within these sources, a seamless and thorough study of the history of the Hilton family in Chicago and in modern memory more broadly would not be possible/exist. This edition is dedicated to them both, their forebears, their descendants, and anyone who is fortunate enough to consider them as “kin”.
   The Hilton family can conclusively trace back their American origins to the latter half of the 17th century, when they settled in lands located in St. Mary’s County, Maryland, before eventually making their way to North Carolina, where they congregated until making a move westward in the years following the American Revolution to the mountainous region along the North Fork of the Holston River in the area which would become the unincorporated community of Hiltons in Scott County, Virginia. The parents of both Alma and Richard Hilton, Almer Eric Hilton (1901-1952) and Effie Malinda Hilton, née Sims (1902-1979, both grew up on the farms and rolling hills of Scott County, but both had the desire shared by so many of their fellow “bright young things” of the period to go make names for themselves and to earn wages which could support better lives for themselves and their family. This is why in the early 1920s they both set off for the “big city”, which for them was Detroit. Effie, who was a bookkeeper, stayed with her brothers in Detroit, and soon met up with and started going with her distant cousin, Almer, whom she saw as a familiar face from home amongst the hustle and bustle of the unfamiliar “Motor City”. The two were married in June of 1926 and moved back home to Virginia, eventually settling in Kingsport, Tennessee, which is where their daughter Alma (1927-2013) was born. 
   Almer soon took up a job as a salesman with Sterchi Bros. furniture store in Kingsport, where his strong knowledge of electronics became apparent through his efforts selling radios in the showroom, and soon he was offered a temporary job with the Grigsby-Grunow Company out of Chicago, owners and manufacturers of the prestigious Majestic line of radio equipment. That is until the stock market crashed. He naturally lost his position, and soon thereafter lost the house in Kingsport.. Luckily, after a short while, he was able to get a position with the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad, perhaps due to connections that he had made in assisting with the installation of radio equipment on C&NW parlor cars during his time with Majestic, and was tasked with working in the Homan Avenue Yards on the Near West Side, where he notably helped in the outfitting and maintenance of President Roosevelt’s private railcar which had custom handrails fitted throughout to act as an aid to the advanced effect that Polio had on his mobility. He also was tasked with controlling all automatic train stops on all C&NW streamliners up until the time of his death, including the prestigious “400” which ran complete service from Chicago to the Twin Cities up in Minnesota. 
   Upon his sudden and tragic death in 1952, Effie  was now the sole breadwinner, and took up a job with Blue Cross Insurance, a position she held until retirement, at which she began volunteering at Shriner’s Hospital in Chicago. Alma would go on to attend Steinmetz High School and be employed by Mars, the massive candy manufacturers located at Oak Park & Armitage Avenues, which is where she met the man who would eventually become her husband, William Bernard Marsells (1927-1991). The couple would end up having seven daughters together and Bill would find a career in shipping and traffic management for Brach Candy, Helene Curtis, American Motors, Allied Shipping, and others. Almer & Effie’s son, Richard Allen Hilton (b. 1936), attended Lane Technical High School and Elmhurst College, before going back to school later in his career to get degrees in education from Northern Illinois University. He would marry Miss Nancy Holtz (b. 1939?) and three daughters would be born as a result of this union. Both Richard and Nancy are alive and well, retired, and spending their time on pastimes of lake management and wildlife rehabilitation respectively in Wonder Lake, Illinois.

# About this Edition

The authors of this edition have formatted, organized, and edited the materials included within in a manner which is both intended to convey and represent the original style, nature, and physical characteristics of said materials as they are presented in their original form, while also making efforts to increase the usability and accessibility of the works through the implementation of a streamlined and comprehensive format throughout. Special attention has been given to both preserving unique qualities of the primary sources—such as photographic arrangements, irregular templating, and original sequencing—as well as the cleaning up of certain spelling, punctuational, and formatting errors if deemed as potentially inhibiting the legibility or clarity/flow of the texts while not detracting from the integrity or “personality” of said original works. It should be noted by the reader that the contents of this multimedia edition (photographs, letters, genealogical ID pages, scrapbook/album components, & digitally typed and scanned transcriptions) are included together here as a grouping both due to the fact that they are contained in one singular assembled binder, as well as their similar and related subject matter. Typed transcriptions were edited and formatted with the help of both Google Docs and Adobe Acrobat. Careful review was conducted to ensure that digital transcriptions created for this edition did not stray from or alter the original characteristics and integrity of the typed documents.

Furthermore, it should be made clear that the collection of documents and sources included and presented here as part of this edition make up just a limited portion of extant components of this genealogical archive amassed by the Hilton and Marsells families and their subsequent branches, and have been selected both due to their value in representing a wide scope of the greater collection, as well as the nature in which this small assemblage of articles has been compiled, allowing it to be used as a tool to help indicate both the methods utilized in this particular period of family recordkeeping and the individuals who took part in it. With this in mind, make note that additional information from said greater archive may be conveyed through the use of supplementary footnotes to aid in context. Finally, it should be made clear that judgements of the parameters and extent of this edition were ultimately left to be decided upon by its authors, and are derived from said authors’ most neutral and objective considerations on the basis of preservation, clarity, and consistency.
