# Introduction

Word count: 250–450 words

This is the first written element of an edition: the first content readers encounter.

The purpose of this introduction is to set the scene: to provide an initial description of the source as well as an overview your edition, highlighting its features and supplements. This is not a space for much detail about the source or our editorial work with it. Later sections will allow you to do that. Here, your job is to help readers understand that they are looking at a digital edition of a historical source and why that source is interesting.

The premium is on precise, no-nonsense prose.

At bottom, you should include:

**How to Cite:**
Here, provide a citation using this model:

> Lastname, Firstname, FirstName LastName, and FirstName, Lastname. “Title of Web Page.” Name of Website (if different from web page). Publication or Revision Date. URL.

Your teams have multiple authors.  In scholarship, if authorship is equal across all team members, then the custom is to list by last name them in alphabetical order.  If you wish to deviate from this order you can but that will communicate priority (i.e. that the one who goes first is the 'lead author', etc.).

If you choose and wish to do so, you may also include a Creative Commons license here. We'll discuss those in class.

Here and throughout your edition, you should use footnotes in Chicago Notes and Bibliography style.[^1]  Please note that if sources are listed in your bibliography (and all your main ones should be), you may use a shortened form in these notes (e.g. Smith, _Towards a Better Understanding_, 5, with the full citation to Smith going in the bibliography).

# The Source

Sample:
Entering The Work Force


My working career started in May 1943, I had just turned 16 and immediately went to my high school counselor and got my working permit. I applied at a few different places, Alden's (a competitor of Sears) hired me and I was so excited - I was hired as a clerk and would be earning 12 ½ cents an hour (Wow!). Alden's was located on Grand Avenue, just a block west of Harlem Avenue, on the north side of the street - where Goldblatt's eventually took over. Would you believe, I was there only 2 days when Montgomery Ward's called and asked me to work there. I was so excited that I told Alden's I was quitting- after all, Montgomery Wards offered to double my wages - I would be earning 25 cents an hour. (Ward's was located on Grand Avenue, exactly across the street from Alden’s) Yippee!


Life at Montgomery Ward's was not so glamorous! The first week they had me dusting, cleaning, and watering their house plants. They had live houseplants in the middle of the store. The plants were in individual pots, but they must have been planted in "pop-up" soil, as there was more dirt and mud outside and around the plants than there was inside the pots. The dirt must have been a good inch deep around the base of all the pots. - Yuck! They did not give me any tools to work with; so I improvised with cardboard, etc. Naturally I fell back on Mother Nature's gifts to me, my fingernails. I would spend hours at night soaking and cleaning my hands, and repairing my broken and dirty nails. I was very unhappy; but the worst was yet to come!!!!!!!!!!

This section provides the main presentation of your source, as you have prepared it for readers (i.e., a facsimile, transcription, video, audio clip, etc.). This section is where we satisfy the first of the ADE’s three criteria for an electronic edition by providing a rigorous, accurate presentation of historical material.

For the presentation of some sources, it may make sense to break up the presentation into multiple pages. For that, as needed, we can use a more book like template (binding multiple pages together) that I can provide. Nonetheless, this page should be the page from which all presentations of the source itself start.

This may also be a space where editorial annotations are provided, such as notes on provenance, archival location, transcription, and more. If possible, a link to the source’s permanent digital location should be included here as well as a citation for that location. This should be done in consultation with the instructors, editorial board, and peer reviewers.

Please note: some presentations may benefit from a multipage format (rather than one scrolling page, as here). I can make a multipage template available to you as needed.

# About this Source

Word count: 1000 words (excluding footnotes)

This section contains a short biography or history of your source. This section helps readers understand the context in which the source was made, and the kinds of historical topics and questions it illuminates.  It also helps to satisfy the second of the ADE’s "Minimum Standards for Electronic Editions," explanatory annotation.

"About this Source" should answer questions like:

    How, when, and where was this artifact created?
    For what purpose? To what effect?
    Who used it, when, where, why?
    What sorts of histories and historical debates has it been used in? How might we use it in our explorations of the past today?

To answer these questions, you will be drawing on your collective research for the Research Assignment.

The target length of this section is about 1000 words, exclusive of notes. It should contain footnotes that substantiate and support your research into the artifact and its history. Here, as throughout, the focus should be on clean, clear prose.

# About this Edition

The authors of this edition have formatted, organized, and edited the materials included within in a manner which is both intended to convey and represent the original style, nature, and physical characteristics of said materials as they are presented in their original form, while also making efforts to increase the usability and accessibility of the works through the implementation of a streamlined and comprehensive format throughout. Special attention has been given to both preserving unique qualities of the primary sources—such as photographic arrangements, irregular templating, and original sequencing—as well as the cleaning up of certain spelling, punctuational, and formatting errors if deemed as potentially inhibiting the legibility or clarity/flow of the texts while not detracting from the integrity or “personality” of said original works. It should be noted by the reader that the contents of this multimedia edition (photographs, letters, genealogical ID pages, scrapbook/album components, & digitally typed and scanned transcriptions) are included together here as a grouping both due to the fact that they are contained in one singular assembled binder, as well as their similar and related subject matter. Typed transcriptions were edited and formatted with the help of both Google Docs and Adobe Acrobat. Careful review was conducted to ensure that digital transcriptions created for this edition did not stray from or alter the original characteristics and integrity of the typed documents.

Furthermore, it should be made clear that the collection of documents and sources included and presented here as part of this edition make up just a limited portion of extant components of this genealogical archive amassed by the Hilton and Marsells families and their subsequent branches, and have been selected both due to their value in representing a wide scope of the greater collection, as well as the nature in which this small assemblage of articles has been compiled, allowing it to be used as a tool to help indicate both the methods utilized in this particular period of family recordkeeping and the individuals who took part in it. With this in mind, make note that additional information from said greater archive may be conveyed through the use of supplementary footnotes to aid in context. Finally, it should be made clear that judgements of the parameters and extent of this edition were ultimately left to be decided upon by its authors, and are derived from said authors’ most neutral and objective considerations on the basis of preservation, clarity, and consistency.

# Supplements

Should you wish to include any supplemental materials--such as specific forms of source commentary or illustrations--they may be provided here.  They are not required. If you do not have any supplements, please eliminate this field.

# Credits and Acknowledgments
